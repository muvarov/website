            Linaro has driven open source software development on Arm since 2010, providing the tools, Linux kernel
            quality, multimedia and security needed for a solid foundation to innovate on. One of the main reasons
            Linaro was formed was to consolidate the Arm code base as multiple companies were frequently trying to
            upstream the same code - causing fragmentation and delay to product deployments. Linaro was therefore
            formed to provide a collaborative forum for companies to work together on foundational open source
            software on Arm. For more information on the work we do on tools, Linux kernel quality, multimedia and
            security, go to [https://www.linaro.org/engineering/core/](/engineering/core/)

            Linaro works within many different verticals and within each of these verticals there are many different
            [projects](/projects/). As an important partner within the open source community, Linaro has over one hundred
            maintainers. We are also one of the top contributors to the development of the Linux kernel.

            As a collaborative forum, Linaro is not just the place where Arm software is consolidated, developed and
            maintained. We also bring companies together to identify business opportunities and enable new markets
            on Arm architecture. This has resulted in multiple Linaro groups focused on specific verticals that now
            includes Artificial Intelligence, Autonomous Vehicles, Consumer, Datacenter & Cloud, Edge & Fog
            Computing and IoT & Embedded. In 2016 Linaro also created 96Boards, a range of hardware
            specifications which are open and define a standard board layout for SoC-agnostic development platforms
            - making the latest Arm-based processors available to developers at a reasonable cost. For more
            information on 96Boards, go to [www.96Boards.org](https://www.96boards.org).

            Linaro is member driven. Member engineers’ work with Linaro engineers to solve common software
            problems. Our members also sit on technical steering committees where together with Linaro and other
            member companies, decisions are made on what work needs to be done. Being a Linaro member in effect
            means shaping the future of Arm software.

            In addition to Linaro membership, companies can also leverage Linaro Arm software expertise on specific
            projects by working with Linaro Developer Services.
